            <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
         
             <p>Hacking is an increasing concern in the 21st century which can lead to grave consequences if the sensitive information falls in the wrong hands. This “unauthorized intrusion” into computer networks has given many people sleepless nights causing a massive monetary and physical damage.
         
       
         
             Hackers are broadly classified into three kinds—white hats, grey hats, and black hats—depending upon their reason behind the hacking. Some have gone ahead and added blue hats, red hats, and green hats to the categories of hackers based on their beliefs and behaviors. China accounts for the world’s highest number of hackers which at the end of 2012 accounted for 41% of the global hacking traffic.</p>

            <h2>When?</h2>
            <p>In August 2007, 17-year-old George Hotz unlocked an iPhone becoming the first known person to do so. Unlocked iPhones were of high value as then they could be used with any of the carriers which was not what Apple or AT&T wanted. When he unlocked his second iPhone, he traded it for a Nissan 350z and three 8 GB iPhones with Certicell founder Terry Daidone. His was a hardware-based unlocking method which was the rage until an anonymous group discovered a software-based one.</p>

             <h2>What did he?</h2>
            <p>He intercepted 3,000 messages that gave him access to usernames and passwords of several employees that also gave him access to ten military computers.</p>
        
            <h2>Crimes:</h2>
            <p>When he was arrested, computer crimes were not fully codified, and since he was a juvenile, he was charged with two counts of “juvenile delinquency.” He was placed under a six-month home arrest and asked to write apology letters to NASA and DOD. If he had committed the crime three years later, he would have been imprisoned for at least ten years and would have had to pay a fine of thousands of dollars.</p>
